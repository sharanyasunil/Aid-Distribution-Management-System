# Aid Distribution Management System

This project is a full-stack web application built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Thymeleaf** for the frontend. It allows donors to list available donation items and organizations to list required items, enabling a seamless donation-matching process. The system also tracks points for donors and logs all donation activities.

Before running the project, rename the root folder to demo.

This is necessary because the Java package structure is com.example.demo and Spring Boot expects the root folder name to match the Maven artifact ID.
